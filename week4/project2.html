            Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a distribution of loans for elligible small businesses has caused a substantial demand for bookkeepers in the small business market. There are many avenues an individual can take to prepare one's self to become a successful book-keeper. Some find this lack of structure frustrating or even at times, overwhelming. For this reason, I have compiled a simplified list of necessary information a person must be familiar with prior to pursuing a career in bookkeeping. This list includes but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Familiarizng oneself on one or more bookkeeping platforms, such as QuickBooks</li>
                <li>Understand the terminologies assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses</li>
                <li>Learn to read Chart of Accounts, Balance Sheet, Income Statements, and Cash-Flow Statements</li>
                <li>Understand tax forms 1099 and 1096</li>
                <li>Decide on a professional business name and ensure its availability</li>
                <li>Freshen up on people skills</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning how to efficiently navigate and organize accounts on QuickBooks or another bookkeeping platform is crucial to your success as a bookkeeper and your clients success and peace of mind. There are inspired programs available for purchase that provide structure and support to learn a platform, or, QuickBooks offers free courses and an end of course certification. This certification is beneficial whether an additional program is pursued because having a QuickBooks certification creates a ProAdvisor badge which populates for potential clients to acknowledge. This gives a person's profile more credibility which will help to accelerate the building of one's clientele. Reference comparisons of the success rates of attaining clients for variable first-year bookkeepers with or without their certification in the table below:
