                Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a distribution of loans for elligible small businesses has caused a substantial demand for bookkeepers in the small business market. There are many avenues an individual can take to prepare one's self to become a successful book-keeper. Some find this lack of structure frustrating or even at times, overwhelming. For this reason, I have compiled a simplified list of necessary information a person must be familiar with prior to pursuing a career in bookkeeping. This list includes but is not limited to:

                Learning how to efficiently navigate and organize accounts on QuickBooks or another bookkeeping platform is crucial to your success as a bookkeeper and your clients success and peace of mind.

This gives a person's profile more credibility which will help to accelerate the building of one's clientele. Reference comparisons of the success rates of attaining clients for variable first-year bookkeepers with or without their certification in the table below:
