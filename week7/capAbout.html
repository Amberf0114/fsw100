            <h1>What is <span class="H1">Starline</span> Bookkeeping?</h1>

            <h1><span class="H1">Starline's</span> <span class="about1"> Inspiration</span></h1>
                <h3>Starline's manager, Amber Freeman, was inspired to create Starline Bookkeeping for two reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal experience of the hardships in trying to keep up with finances alongside running a successful business</li>
                        <li>Motivation to give back services to small local businesses</li>
                    </ul>
                </h3>
                <h3>Ms. Freeman is the daughter of micro-business owner Curtis Freeman of Freeman's Automotive and Armory LLC, and personally witnessed the challenges and stress her father faced by managing all odds and ends on his own. Because of this, she stepped up to the plate and gained her certification in bookkeeping. She began by helping her father with his business and later extended services to local and nonlocal business alike.</h3>
